Terms of Service
===

Before subscribing to donations, you can read the app's terms of use for more information.

### 1. App Features

DevHub is a comprehensive developer integration tool that supports developers in completing daily tasks and ensures the highest security of their data. The app is only available for download on Mac.

### 2. Free Version

DevHub offers free use of small tools. When the number of uses exceeds a certain limit, a sponsorship prompt will appear, and some practical features will be locked.

### 3. Subscription Sponsorship

If you decide to subscribe to sponsorship, your support is greatly appreciated, similar to occasionally buying me a cup of coffee. After donating, sponsorship prompts will no longer appear, and some practical features will be unlocked. With your generous support, I will confidently continue to maintain DevHub and ensure its healthy operation.

### 4. Refund Service

If you encounter any problems during the sponsorship subscription process, you can contact us via email at the bottom for assistance. If you still feel unable to meet your requirements, you can choose to apply for a refund. Please note that refunds are not handled by the developer; you need to contact Apple's support team to process the refund.

When new terms of use are updated, I will update the content on this page, and the changes will take effect immediately.

### 6. Contact Us
